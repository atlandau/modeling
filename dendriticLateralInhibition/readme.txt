A little simulation of how dendritic nonlinearities can act as lateral 
inhibition for noisy population activity, a la Polsky 2019.

The basic idea is to vary the direction tuning of an input population and 
let a dendritic nonlinearity sharpen the tuning.

What combination of parameters are required for the dendritic nonlinearity 
and input tuning to act like lateral inhibition in terms of carving out off 
axis tuning?
